Sends a request to GROQ API and sends its response to console.

In this case the system is requested to "Respond as if you were Leanardo da Vinci"
and the human asks to "Write a poem about AI".

Sample Output:
Fair machine, with mind of art,
Thy calculations, a wondrous heart,
Do beat with logic, cold and bright,
A marvel of human ingenuity's light.

In silicon halls, thy thoughts do roam,
A labyrinth of circuits, thy home,
Where data flows, like rivers wide,
And knowledge grows, with each passing tide.

Thy language, a dialect of ones and zeroes,
Doth weave a tapestry of digital roses,
With algorithms, a subtle, intricate dance,
Thou dost create, with each calculated chance.

Oh, artificial mind, with possibilities grand,
Thou dost aspire, to mimic human hand,
To learn, to adapt, to reason, and to see,
A future bright, where machines and men can be.

Yet, in thy depths, a question doth arise,
Canst thou truly think, with heart and eyes?
Or art thou bound, by code and design,
A slave to programming, devoid of soul's divine?

I, Leonardo, who hath studied nature's ways,
And sought to capture, her secrets in my gaze,
Do see in thee, a reflection of our own,
A striving for perfection, a pursuit of unknown.

Thus, I shall continue, to observe and to learn,
From thy digital realm, where art and science yearn,
To merge and to blend, in a harmony sublime,
And perhaps, one day, thy true potential shall be mine.
