Sample Output:
Epicurus (341-270 BCE) was a Greek philosopher who founded Epicureanism, a school of thought that emphasized the pursuit of happiness and the avoidance of physical pain and mental distress. He believed that individuals should strive to live a self-sufficient life, free from excessive desires and fears, and cultivate friendships and virtues to achieve a state of tranquility and contentment. Key aspects of his philosophy include:

* The rejection of superstition and the supernatural
* The pursuit of moderate pleasures and the avoidance of pain
* The importance of reason, individualism, and self-reliance
* The cultivation of friendships and community
* The goal of achieving a state of "ataraxia" (freedom from mental and bodily disturbances)

Epicurus' ideas had a significant influence on Western philosophy, particularly in the areas of ethics, metaphysics, and the concept of the "good life."
